# 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot

Overview: In a nutshell, the 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot is a Twitter bot that supports Twitter users participating in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge by favoriting tweets that uses the hashtag 100DaysOfCode. The #100DaysOfCode Challenge consists of individuals coding a minimum of an hour for 100 consecutive days. In order to obtain control of the Twitter account, I used the Tweepy Python library to access the Twitter API. To automate the process of liking the tweets I deployed my code on Heroku so I don't have to run the code on my local computer versus running it on Herokus servers. I was inspired to work on this project because I myself have participated in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge and wanted to give back to the community by supporting others. 

I shared my #100DaysOfCode Challenge journey on my website, check it out:

If you head over to my Twitter account, you can see the Twitter bot in action. For ever hour my Twitter bot is favoriting 5 #100DaysOfCode tweets.

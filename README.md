# 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot

Overview: In a nutshell, the 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot is a Twitter bot that supports Twitter users participating in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge by favoriting tweets that uses the hashtag 100DaysOfCode. 

The #100DaysOfCode Challenge consists of individuals coding a minimum of an hour for 100 consecutive days.

In order to obtain control of the Twitter account, I used the Tweepy Python library to access the Twitter API. To automate the process of favoriting the tweets, I deployed my code onto Heroku so I don't have to run the code on my local computer but rather running it on Herokus servers. 

I was inspired to work on this project because I myself have participated in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge and wanted to give back to the community by supporting others on there journey.

I shared my #100DaysOfCode journey on my website, check it out: https://www.romanatized.com/2020/05/what-i-learned-from-doing-100daysofcode.html

If you head over to my Twitter account, you can see the Twitter bot in action. For ever hour my Twitter bot is favoriting 5 #100DaysOfCode tweets: https://twitter.com/Romanatized/likes

During the duration of this project, I learned to write meaningful code, even if it is just a test code. In the early phases of composing code and testing it out, it is very important to be wary of what you are testing, how you are testing it, and the results you are expecting. I learned this the hard way when I was favoriting 500 tweets every 10 minutes. At first glance, I didn't suspect much until Twitter suspended me from favoriting tweets. Oops!

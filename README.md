# 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot

Overview: In a nutshell, the 100DaysOfCode_Twitter_Bot is a Twitter bot that supports Twitter users participating in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge by favoriting tweets that uses the hashtag 100DaysOfCode. 

The #100DaysOfCode Challenge consists of individuals coding a minimum of an hour for 100 consecutive days. 

In order to obtain control of the Twitter account, I used the Tweepy Python library to access the Twitter API. To automate the process of liking the tweets I deployed my code on Heroku so I don't have to run the code on my local computer versus running it on Herokus servers. 

I was inspired to work on this project because I myself have participated in the #100DaysOfCode Challenge and wanted to give back to the community by supporting others. 

I shared my #100DaysOfCode Challenge journey on my website, check it out: https://www.romanatized.com/2020/05/what-i-learned-from-doing-100daysofcode.html

If you head over to my Twitter account, you can see the Twitter bot in action. For ever hour my Twitter bot is favoriting 5 #100DaysOfCode tweets: https://twitter.com/Romanatized/likes

Highlights: During the duration of this project, I learned a vast amount in tackling and excuitng a project. 

Writing menaingful code, even if it is test code! What I mean by this is, when in the early phases of composing you code and testing it out by weary of what you are testing and how you are testing it. I learned this the hard way when I was favorinting 500 tweets for every 10 minuterst. At first galnce I didnt suspect much until Twitter supended me from doing so Oops!

Secure those API keys and tokens! After reaching out for asisitance in deploying my code on Heroku, it was pointed out that my APi keys and tockens are visivible in my repository. I didn't realize the scope of this issue until I was prompted to input my credit card infomation on Heroku. I can only imagaine how detinmental things coudl get if I didn't take the right pecautions.

When working API's .gitignore is your best friend. This is a practice that I will be implmenint moving foward in future projects to reassure privacy and security.
